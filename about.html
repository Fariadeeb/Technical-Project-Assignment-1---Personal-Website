          I'm Ghifari Adib Ibdafa. I'm a student who is also a novice UI/UX designer. Throughout the lectures, I strengthened and acquired a UI design skills,
          such as visual design, user research, as well as UX writing skills. My design philosophy is centered around the idea that good design is not just
          visually pleasing, but also intuitive and easy to use. I strive to create designs that not only look great but also make life easier for the end-user.
          I am also knowledgeable in front-end development languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows me to create designs that are not only
          visually appealing but also functionally sound.

        <p class="aboutDesc">
          While I'm not designing a user interface, I enjoy reading novels and mangas. I frequently read manga that falls within the psychology and
          slice-of-life categories. I read literature authored by authors like Haruki Murakami, Osamu Dazai, Franz Kafka, and others who commonly use
          storytelling to explore existentialism. I also enjoy watching movies and television shows, particularly those that deal with psychological issues and
          examine the nuances of interpersonal interactions.
